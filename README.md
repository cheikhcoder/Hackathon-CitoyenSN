## Project Overview

**PatrioteSN** is designed to assist users in getting quick answers to legal questions related to Senegalese law. The project provides:

- **Multilingual Chatbot**: Users can ask legal questions in French, English, Russian, or Wolof, and receive responses in the same language.
- **Audio Transcription**: Users can upload audio files with questions, which are transcribed to text.
- **Document Summarization**: Users can upload PDF documents to get concise summaries.
- **Translation to Wolof**: French responses can be translated into Wolof using a custom translation model.

## Technologies and Models Used

### Libraries

- **Streamlit**: For building the web application interface.
- **PyPDF2**: To extract text from PDF files for summarization.
- **LangChain**: Provides tools for chatbot functionality, embeddings, and vector storage.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For translation using the `cifope/nllb-200-wo-fr-distilled-600M` model.
- **OpenAI API**: Used for the Whisper model for audio transcription and GPT models for language generation.

### Models

1. **Whisper Model (OpenAI)**: Used for converting audio input to text.
2. **NLLB-200 Model (Hugging Face)**: `cifope/nllb-200-wo-fr-distilled-600M` for French-to-Wolof translation.
3. **OpenAI ChatGPT**: Provides conversational AI responses to questions in various languages.

### Techniques

1. **Text Splitting and Chunking**: Splits large text into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
2. **Vector Storage with FAISS**: Stores embeddings for retrieval.
3. **Conversational Memory**: Maintains conversation context using LangChain’s `ConversationBufferMemory`.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.
- Access to OpenAI API and Hugging Face API for model usage.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PatrioteSN.git
   cd PatrioteSN
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the Required Packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
     ```plaintext
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
     HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
     ```

5. **Download Models (Optional)**
   - The Hugging Face model for Wolof translation will be downloaded automatically the first time it’s used. However, you can download it manually if desired.

## Running the Project

To start the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The app will open in your default web browser, showing the homepage with navigation options.

---

## Usage

### 1. **Homepage**
   - Introduces the project and provides navigation options for the chatbot and document summarization.

### 2. **Chatbot Page**
   - **Select Language**: Choose a language for interaction (French, English, Russian, or Wolof).
   - **Ask a Question**: Type a question or upload an audio file (MP3, WAV, M4A). The app will transcribe the audio using Whisper and provide a response.
   - **Translate to Wolof**: After receiving a response in French, click "Translate to Wolof" to view the answer in Wolof.

### 3. **Document Summarization**
   - **Upload PDF**: Upload one or more PDF files containing legal documents.
   - **Summarize**: The app will provide a concise summary of each document.

## Code Explanation

1. **Audio Transcription**:
   - The `transcribe_audio()` function uses OpenAI's Whisper model to convert audio input to text.

2. **Chatbot**:
   - The chatbot uses OpenAI's ChatGPT model, with LangChain’s `ConversationalRetrievalChain` and `ConversationBufferMemory` for conversational context.

3. **Translation**:
   - The `translate_to_wolof()` function utilizes the Hugging Face `cifope/nllb-200-wo-fr-distilled-600M` model for French-to-Wolof translation.

4. **PDF Summarization**:
   - Text is extracted from PDF files using `PyPDF2`, split into chunks, and summarized using OpenAI’s language model.
